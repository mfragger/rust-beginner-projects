# Rust Beginner Projects

List from http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/3473/

This is a list of beginner projects for learning a language.

Here're the tasks

1. [x] Write a programme which finds the factorial of a number entered by the user. (check for all conditions).
2. [x] Develop a programme to convert currency X to currency Y and vice versa.
3. [x] Write a programme that prints out a triangle from largest to smallest; user inputs the largest number. Eg:

```
*****
****
***
**
*
```

4. [x] Write a programme that prints out a triangle from smallest to largest; user inputs bottom number. Eg:

```
*
**
***
****
******
```

5. [x] Print out a triangle from smallest to largest, skipping even rows. User inputs largest number, eg:

```
*
***
*****
*******
```

6. [x] Develop a programme that uses a randomly generated number to select 1 of 3 (or more) functions to show the user.
7. [x] Guessing game. ask the user to guess a number between 1 and a 100. If you guessed correctly, it will say you win. If you're too high or too low it will also let you know.
8. [x] Create a programme which generates Fibonacci series til a number 'n', where 'n' is entered by the user. Eg if the user enters 10 then the output would be: `1 1 2 3 5 8`
9. [x] Given a string, determine how many of the characters are vowels and how many are consonants. Terminate the string when the input character encountered is non-alphabetic.
10. [x] Find the Fifth root of the sum of the squares of the first 100 ODD numbers only.
11. [x] List all possible combinations of letters in a 4-letter word. Eg 'TEST' can be unscrambled as TEST, TETS, TSET, TSTE, TTSE, TTES, etc.
12. [x] Make a programme that allows the user to input either the radius, diameter, or area of the circle. The programme should then calculate the other 2 based on the input.
13. [x] Determine how much money is in a piggy bank that contains several £2 coins, £1 coins, 50p coins, 20p coins, 10p coins and 5p coins. Use the following values to test your programme: one £2, three £1, five 50p  coins, two 20p coins, one 10p coin and fifteen 5p coins.
14. [x] Create a simple palindrome checker programme. The programme should allow the user to enter a string and check whether the given string is a palindrome or not. Only digits and alphabets should be considered while checking for palindromes - any other characters are to be ignored.
15. [x] Write a programme that allows you to input students' midterm, final and homework scores, and calculate a weighted score. Use the following weights: 20% midterm, 40% final, 40% median homework.
